#Node.js NodeMvcMusicStore sample

This small project is a personal learning exercise on node, express, mongo, and structuring modules to best conform to a familiar MVC paradigm that will continue to be maintainable in a large application.  I started out with Ben Edmunds' [Node-Express-MVR-Example](https://github.com/benedmunds/Node-Express-MVR-Example) and have customized it to my own satisfaction.
